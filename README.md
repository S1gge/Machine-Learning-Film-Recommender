# 🎬 Film Recommener System
 
## Introduction
This film recommender system suggests movies based on the similarity of movie descriptions, which are generated using the movie's genre and tags. The system uses the CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer from sklearn to process and transform text data into a format that can be used to calculate the cosine similarity between movies.

## 🚀 How to Start?

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/S1gge/Machine-Learning-Film-Recommender
```

### 📜 Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Python 3.8** or higher

- **Pandas**

- **Numpy**

- **scikit-learn**

### ⚙️ If you don't have it yet, install manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### 🗂️ Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd your-repository-name
```

## ▶️ Run the program.
```bash
python film_recommender.py
```

## 💡Conclusion.
This recommender system is a simple but effective way to suggest movies based on the similarity of their descriptions. By using text vectorization techniques like CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer, the system processes movie genres and tags to generate useful recommendations based on cosine similarity. The program is easy to install and use and can be extended to accommodate more complex recommendation techniques or additional data sources in the future.
